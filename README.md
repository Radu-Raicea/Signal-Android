# Signal Android 

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.

Signal uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

Currently available on the Play store.

## Contributing Code
Instructions on how to setup your development environment and build Signal can be found in  [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

If you're new to the Signal codebase, we recommend going through our issues and picking out a simple bug to fix (check the "easy" label in our issues) in order to get yourself familiar. Also please have a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), that might answer some of your questions.

For larger changes and feature ideas, we ask that you propose it on the [unofficial Community Forum](https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net) for a high-level discussion with the wider community before implementation.
